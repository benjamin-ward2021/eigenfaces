This repository is based on the case study <a href="http://www.vision.jhu.edu/teaching/vision08/Handouts/case_study_pca1.pdf">Eigenfaces for Face Detection/Recognition</a>.<br><br>
If you think of a 150x130 grayscale image as a point in 19500 dimensional space (150*130 = 19500), you can then use PCA on that image to reduce the dimensionality as a form of compression.
This repo demonstrates how to apply PCA to images as well as how to reconstruct images from an original image that was projected onto a lower dimensionality subspace.
